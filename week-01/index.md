# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

## My Ethical Lens
<!-- 3–4 sentences -->
The framework that I feel fits me best is the Deontological ethics framework. The reason I feel this way is because it is pretty close to exactly the way I would be thinking about problems in technology. I'm usually thinking about what could best fit an issue while protecting human rights and if that solution may be right or wrong ethically.

## Authorization Principle
<!-- 2–3 sentences: one-sentence definition + concrete campus example -->
The authorization principle defines who has authorization to be able to access certain resources and verifies if they are human. On campus this is used when you log into the wifi to verify whether you are human and allow you to use the wifi under certain conditions.
