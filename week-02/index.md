# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 2)

## Principles Summary
Notice/consent is being transparent with how the users data, and what data will be used if the user agrees. Purpose limitation is limiting the purpose in your notice to only what is necessary and staying true to your word, no outside uses of your notice. Data minimization is when you only gather the most necessary information and get rid of it as soon as possible, you want to make it so only the smallest amount of data can be compromised. Proportionality is when monitoring is done the in the least intrusive way possible and only if necessary in managing risk.

## My Monitoring and Retention Clause
Hocking College monitors lab computers connected in room JLH 357 to protect operations and comply with policy. Monitoring is limited to logging the start/stop of computer and auth events for security purposes. Users receive notice at sign-in and through the AUP; personal communications are not reviewed except as required by law or incident response.

Hocking College collects the minimum data necessary, restricts access to trained staff, and exceptions require written approval from trained staff. Retains monitoring data for 30 days unless required longer for investigations or legal holds. Access logs are reviewed by Hocking College quarterly. Individuals may raise concerns or appeal via helpdesk@hocking.edu. Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action.

## Justification
When creating the monitoring and retention clause I'd say all 4 of the big principles were used. Notice/consent is a given when creating a clause like this, and purpose limitation is all over the clause itself. The second paragraph is mainly purpose limitation as well as data minimization although it is a little weak with the 30 day retention. Lastly the proportionality is done mostly in the first paragraph where I stated what was being monitored and why.
