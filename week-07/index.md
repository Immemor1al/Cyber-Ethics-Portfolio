## Lab/Project Ethics Addendum
[Untitled document.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22821994/Untitled.document.docx)
# Equity & Access Analysis
Nobody within the addendum really loses, unless you are somehow injured by the devices, which is extremely unlikely.
The benefits are more for the researchers as well, they are able to use the findings to make new scientific discoveries. 
The only benefits you might get by participating is getting to be a part of the scientific discoveries.
To mitigate the inequity that might occur from the devices or tools created from the research would only be used for therapeutic purposes or rehabilitation. 
# Justification
The findings of this study may bring up questions about how they should be used. For example, if the findings may give an advantage in things like esports. If you're able to control your keyboard, or mouse with just a wearable BCI with utmost percision it would give an inhuman advantage.
Easy fixes to this are banning them from any esports events, and limiting them to only people who need them to access things like the computer or their phone. If you're paralyzed, you may not be able to do those things. 
# Reflection
If I was to revisit anything, I would probably revisit my consent clause. I was a little confused on how to write it out so I ended up just making an imaginary contract outside the Addendum that the participant would have to sign to allow for participation.
