# Incident Ethics and Evidence Notes

## My First-Hour Priorities:

Within the first hour of an incident you want to capture the minimal amount of info necessary. This makes it so no unnecessary information is divulged and you are able to find the root of the problem without compromising things. Like in the evidence note, I was forced to redact a lot of the IdP sign-in logs so I only had the ones involved in the phishing scam. You want to avoid all the other information if necessary. You also want to only move within the scope and authorization given. This makes it so evidence is tampered with as little as possible so the root of the problem may easier be found. Also only include observations made when inspecting, avoid accusations and speculation.

## Incident and Evidence Note: 

See evidence links because it's a big doc.

## Integrity & Privacy Controls:

Hashing is used to recognize if data has been tampered with or not. Using the original hash, which is a mathmatically created fixed string of characters that changes every time there is an edit made to a file. Where you store these files that you don't want tampered is also important. Not sharing them in chats or other ways of unsafe communication, and storing the files in a restricted evidence path should help keep them from being tampered with. Don't forget to also log the access of the case paths so if tampering is done, it's easier to find out by whom. Lastly is the redaction policy, when collecting information and files, we want the minimum necessary. This means that when we are forging through files, we should only grab the information necessary to the case and redact everything else, be it with a blur of some type, black boxes, or whatever redacts the information. This keeps others information, that has nothing to do with the case, safe from others eyes.
