## AI Use In Security Situations

# AI Policy Snippet
At Hocking College, we use an AI tool to detect and alert students of suspicious activity on their accounts to keep their information safe. These alerts come with the reason for the flag, and the place to contact the helpdesk for any further assistance. All appeals and medium to high-risk alerts are reviewed by the cybersecurity team within 24 hours. The AI handles any low-risk alerts with set decisions, and can be overridden by the cybersecurity team in case of any mistakes. The AI also only uses the minimum necessary information, and may redact any personal info when possible, to detect activities and ensure no student data is exposed or deleted. The data collected is then retained for 90 days and deleted. All cases that are tracked will also be checked quarterly before deleted to ensure the tool is running properly. AI will be retrained yearly and when deemed necessary if the reviewed data isnâ€™t running as expected.

# Justification
This AI fits the risk as it allows us to more safely and accurately keep student data safe. The AI can recognize issues and alert our cybersecurity team with ease compared to humans, who also can't work 24/7 like the AI can. With this AI, not only are we keeping the students data safer, we are able to save money on paying for other tools, or people to do the job. There is very minimum risk for the reward with this AI as any risk can be mitigated by the cybersecurity team reviewing the AI and it's decisions or alerts.
