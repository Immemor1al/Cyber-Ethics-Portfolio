## AI Use In Security Situations

# AI Policy Snippet Example
At Hocking College, we use an AI tool to detect and alert students of suspicious activity on their accounts to keep their information safe. These alerts come with the reason for the flag, and the place to contact the helpdesk for any further assistance. All appeals and medium to high-risk alerts are reviewed by the cybersecurity team within 24 hours. The AI handles any low-risk alerts with the ways it deems necessary, and can be overridden by the cybersecurity team in case of any mistakes. The AI also only uses the minimum necessary information, and may redact any personal info when possible, to detect activities and ensure no student data is exposed or deleted. The data collected is then retained for 90 days and deleted. All cases that are tracked will also be checked quarterly before deleted to ensure the tool is running properly. AI will be retrained yearly and when deemed necessary if the reviewed data isnâ€™t running as expected.
