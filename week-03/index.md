# OSS & Disclosure Readiness (Week 3)

## License Choice:

If I were to choose out of the three main licenses we learned about this week(MIT/GPL/Apache), I'd probably choose MIT. With MIT the obligations aren't hard to follow by any means, and there isn't many to abide by. Accepting the "AS IS" warranty disclaimer and leaving the copyright and MIT License text in the source are all there is to it for obligations. This also allows others to use and distribute pretty easy if they want to while making sure I at least have the credit for the source.

## Initial Vulnerability Report Template:

For now until I get an answer, I have no clue what to do here. With the wording of things in slides and the assignment I assume I'm making a template for a VDP. On the other hand I feel like we're supposed to be using their template, which I assumed was an example, and filling in blanks for our own 'scenario.'
